## Purpose

This app servers to provide users an oerview of the S&P 500 Company historical stock prices in the form of plot and tables.


## Data

The data I used is collected from Yahoo Finance. 

Specifically, I developed a Python script that calls the Yahoo Finance public API to retrieve historical stock prices for the S&P companies.
