## Purpose

This app servers to provide users an overview of the S&P 500 Company historical stock prices in the form of plot and tables.
Users can select any S&P company (a total of 503 companies), and view their historical prices as a reference. Below the plot, there is also some info on the average prices of the selected stock over the time boundary.


## Data

The data I used is collected from Yahoo Finance. 

Specifically, I developed a Python script that calls the Yahoo Finance public API to retrieve historical stock prices for the S&P companies.
